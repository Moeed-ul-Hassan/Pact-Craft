# Legal Contract Template Generator - Detailed AI Builder Prompt

## Project Overview
Build a Legal Contract Template Generator that solves real pain points for freelancers, small agencies, and consultants who need professional contracts but can't afford lawyers. This is a micro-SaaS tool focused on generating customized, legally sound contracts instantly.

## Target Pain Points We're Solving

### 1. **Cost Problem**
- Freelancers/small agencies/consultants need basic contracts (NDA, service agreements, payment terms) but can't afford lawyers
- Solution: Affordable, instant contract generation

### 2. **Time Waste**
- Users waste hours searching Google for generic templates that are mostly outdated or irrelevant
- Solution: Pre-built, up-to-date templates with smart customization

### 3. **Customization Challenge**
- Every client and deal is different (scope, payment schedule, deliverables)
- Solution: Dynamic form-based customization that adapts to specific needs

### 4. **Legal Risk**
- Free templates often have loopholes (missing late payment clauses, unclear termination terms)
- Solution: Lawyer-reviewed templates with essential protection clauses
